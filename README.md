# Sprint 5 - Shopping list app made using React!


Project which I've done for a Sprint 5 task while studying at Baltic Institute of Technology. 

Development progress was tracked by submiting commits using Git CLI.


## Description

Application is named "The Cart+".

Main purpose of this application is to serve as a shopping list, but it can also be used for making other lists like a "To-do list" or any other list of item's or task's.

"The Cart+" is able to save items to browser local storage and load saved items after the browser was closed and opened.

Application is designed to work properly with variety of screen sizes so it can be used on your phone, tablet or computer.

## Opening the app

"The Cart+" is posted using GitHub pages, so it can be simply opened following this [Link](https://zgs3.github.io/Sprint5_React_ShoppingCart/) .

## How to use the app?

Enter any item name you want to save to the list in the input field at the top of the table in the center of the page and press "Enter" or click on the "+" button.
Your new item will appear below the input field. 

* You are able click on the name of the item and it will be marked as "checked".
* You are also able to edit saved item by clicking "pencil icon" on the right side of the item name. 
After clicking "edit" new input field will appear where you can type new item name and press "enter" or click "checkmark" icon.
* Surely you can also delete the item by simply clicking on the "trashcan" icon on the right of the item name.
* Also you can delete all saved items at once by clicking "DELETE ALL" button on the right of the input field.

Don't forget that this app is saving data to the browser local storage, so all your item's will be loaded after you close and open your internet browser again.

* Also you can find information about the app in the "about" page. There are navigation link's at the top right corner of the page where you can navigate to the app and "about" pages.
